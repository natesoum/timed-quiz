  ## Description

  My motivation for this project was to improve on my first take of this project! During my first approach, I wasn't able to give this project a good attempt. Then, I decided to slowly look at the challenge and take a new approach to it. So, I started from scratch again and finally was able to give more effort on this attempt of the coding quiz! 

  I built this project to improve my web development skills all together.

  This app creates a game for users to test their knowledge on  all things web devlelopment while having fun doing so! 

  I learned HTML organization, how important file structure is, website responsive and much more form building this project!
